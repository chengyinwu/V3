========================= INTRODUCTION =========================

QuteRTL is a word-level framework developed for years. It generally 
supports synthesizable Verilog input and BLIF format designs, followed 
by a quick synthesizer which enables synthesizing CDFG (Control Data 
Flow Graph) into word-level netlist, including logics, arithmetics, 
shifters, comparators, FFs ..., etc. Afterwards, it supports us to 
flatten the hierarchical design into single flattened module. 

The abovementioned RTL (Verilog) front-end enables QuteRTL to serve 
other back-end frameworks and applications, including our verification 
and debugging framework, V3. 

In this version of release, we provide our source code for RTL front-end 
only. It is definitely a simplified package from the latest releases of 
QuteRTL as well as a customized RTL front-end for V3. Please refer to 
websites of QuteRTL and V3 for detailed information.
