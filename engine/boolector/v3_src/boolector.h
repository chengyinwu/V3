/**
 * \mainpage Boolector Documentation
 * \section Introduction
 * This is the documentation of Boolector's public interface. Boolector
 * is an SMT solver for the quantifier-free theory of bit-vectors
 * in combination with the quantifier-free extensional theory of arrays.
 * Please visit our <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/boolector">website</a>.
 * It contains:
 * - the latest version
 * - publications related to Boolector
 * - a link to our discussion platform
 * - news
 *
 * Boolector can be used as stand-alone SMT solver which reads either
 *<a href="http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BrummayerBiereLonsing-BPR08.pdf">BTOR</a>
 * and <a href="http://goedel.cs.uiowa.edu/smtlib/papers/format-v1.2-r06.08.30.pdf">SMT-LIB 1.2</a>. Furthermore, Boolector provides a public API in order
 * to use Boolector as backend in other tools.
 *
 * \section Interface
 * The public interface is defined in \ref boolector.h.
 *
 * First of all, the user has to create
 * a boolector instance by calling \ref boolector_new. This instance
 * is needed by all other functions. After creating an instance, the
 * rewrite level of the rewriting engine can be set by
 * \ref boolector_set_rewrite_level and/or
 * model generation can be enabled by \ref boolector_enable_model_gen. Then,
 * the user can build expressions of bit-vectors and arrays. As the design of
 * Boolector was motivated by real hardware, we do not distinguish between
 * the type 'boolean' and the type 'bit-vector of bit-width one'.
 * After building expressions the user can assert them by
 * \ref boolector_assert. The resulting instance can be decided
 * by \ref boolector_sat. If model generation has been enabled
 * and the instance is satisfiable, the user can obtain assignments to
 * bit-vectors resp. arrays by
 * \ref boolector_bv_assignment resp. \ref boolector_array_assignment.
 * The assignments are not limited to variables.
 * They can be obtained for arbitrary expressions.
 * Finally, Boolector supports incremental usage with assumptions analogously
 * to MiniSAT. The incremental usage can be enabled
 * by \ref boolector_enable_inc_usage. Assumptions can be added by
 * \ref boolector_assume.
 *
 * \section Internals
 * Internally, Boolector manages an expression DAG. This means that each
 * expression has a reference counter which is initially set to one.
 * Each sharing increments the reference counter. An expression can be
 * copied by \ref boolector_copy which simply increments the reference counter.
 * An expression can be released by \ref boolector_release which decreases
 * the reference counter. If the reference counter reaches zero, then
 * the expression node is deleted from memory.
 *
 * Already during construction of the expression DAG,
 * rewriting is performed. This rewriting should simplify the DAG already
 * during construction. When \ref boolector_sat is called, Boolector
 * starts an extra rewriting phase to simplify the DAG.
 * The rewrite level can be configured by \ref boolector_set_rewrite_level.
 *
 * Boolector internally uses a set of base operators.
 * The set is documented in
 *<a href="http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BrummayerBiereLonsing-BPR08.pdf">BTOR: Bit-Precise Modelling of Word-Level Problems for Model Checking</a>.
 * Many operators that are available in the API are rewritten as combination
 * of base operators internally. For example, two's complement is rewritten
 * as one's complement and addition of 1.  This behavior is not
 * influenced by the rewrite level.
 *
 * \subsection Assertions
 * Boolector uses two different kinds of assertions. Internally, Boolector
 * heavily uses assertions provided by the standard C library.
 * To increase performance, these assertions are disabled in releases.
 *
 * The functions of Boolector's public interface are guarded by
 * public assertions. Public assertions are always enabled. They check if
 * the functions have been correctly called by the user.
 * If not, then an error message is printed out and 'abort' is called.
 * For example, we call \ref boolector_var and
 * pass NULL as symbol name. Then, we obtain the following error message:
 *
 * \verbatim [boolector] boolector_var: 'symbol' must not be NULL \endverbatim
 *
 * This is not a bug. The user has violated the pre-conditions of the function,
 * and therefore Boolector aborts.
 *
 * \section Examples
 * In the section <a href="examples.html">examples</a> you can
 * find bit-vector and array examples. They demonstrate
 * how Boolector's public interface can be used.
 * \example bv1.c
 * \example bv2.c
 * \example array1.c
 * \example array2.c
 * \example array3.c
